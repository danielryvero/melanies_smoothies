   ***Streamlit Apps!***

This apps were developed as part of the [Hands-On Essentials: Data Application Builders Workshop](https://achieve.snowflake.com/f636883e-f352-4995-9d64-8aef54291a83#acc.ihnZdJz5) course.

Almost like a full-stack developer bootcamp, this course covers a wide array of technologies that will help you 
build applications that use Snowflake as a back end. Including: Streamlit (Python), SnowSQL, REST APIs, and much more.

[Customize your Smoothie](https://melaniessmoothies-danielryvero.streamlit.app/): This app uses a database in Snowflake to store orders for Smoothies and gives nutritional information about them.

[Pending Smoothies Orders](https://melaniessmoothies-pending.streamlit.app/): This app marks the orders submitted in the [Customize your Smoothie](https://melaniessmoothies-danielryvero.streamlit.app/) as filled and removes them from the pending orders table.
