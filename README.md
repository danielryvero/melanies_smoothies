   ***Streamlit Apps!***

This apps were developed as part of the [Hands-On Essentials: Data Application Builders Workshop](https://achieve.snowflake.com/f636883e-f352-4995-9d64-8aef54291a83#acc.ihnZdJz5) course.

Almost like a full-stack developer bootcamp, this course covers a wide array of technologies that will help you 
build applications that use Snowflake as a back end. Including: Streamlit (Python), SnowSQL, REST APIs, and much more.

[Customize your Smoothie](https://melaniessmoothies-danielryvero.streamlit.app/): This app uses a database in Snowflake to store orders for Smoothies and gives nutritional information about them that is brought from [Fruityvice API](https://fruityvice.com/#1).

[Pending Smoothies Orders](https://melaniessmoothies-pending.streamlit.app/): This app marks the orders submitted in the [Customize your Smoothie](https://melaniessmoothies-danielryvero.streamlit.app/) as filled and removes them from the pending orders table.

If you are following the workshop path and you want the applications to work internally with SiS (Streamlit in Snowflake), check my version of those in the folder [Snowflake internal Apps](/Snowflake_internal_Apps), as well as the SQL code I used to build the Database and Tables in Snowflake.

These Apps use Python to collect inputs and write SQL code into a database already set up in Snowflake. Good luck with your app!
